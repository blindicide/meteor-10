Last month, there were major protests in Poland when that country signed ACTA, which has led to the Polish government deciding not to ratify the agreement, for now.
Latvia and Slovakia have both delayed the process of joining ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian abattoirs.
RSPCA New South Wales chief inspector David O'Shannessy told the ABC that surveillance and inspections of abattoirs should be commonplace in Australia.
"The CCTV would certainly send a strong signal to those people working with animals that their welfare is of the highest priority."
The United States Geological Survey international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland in the week prior.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the past 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity resulting in the phase change had took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's summit caldera.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the base of the mountain.
The clouds presented the potential for confusion as to whether an actual eruption had taken place.
The Luno had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel aboard when it broke down and high winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
Helicopters rescued the twelve crewmembers and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre ship was en route to pick up its usual fertiliser cargo and initially officials feared the vessel could spill a load.
The proposed amendment already passed both houses in 2011.
A change was made this legislative session when the second sentence was deleted first by the House of Representatives and then was passed in a similar form by the Senate Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door for civil unions in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be reviewed again by the next elected legislature in either 2015 or 2016 to remain in process.
Vautier's achievements outside of directing include a hunger strike in 1973 against what he viewed as political censorship.
French law was changed. His activism went back to age 15 when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in a 1998 book.
In the 1960s he headed back to newly-independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was announced as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
As well as a former Olympic and World champion, Saito was the All Japan Judo Federation training committee chairman at the time of his death.
At least 100 people had attended the party, in order to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple whose wedding was held last year.
A formal anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, officials said.
The couple had married in Texas one year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not hurt.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career.
In his notes he used words which some parents considered coarse, and he reportedly used profanity in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.
He has also been accused previously of copyright infringement, but was not charged.
A former student said that he 'used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like the students' friend.'
During the last three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has grown by 90 times.
For the first time, last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the biggest market for this industry.
China's GDP could be larger than the United States within two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, Bobek gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
No one else has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted the best player in Partizan's history.
The celebrations started with a special show by the world-renowned group Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then Whirling Dervishes took to the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
To finish, Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia performed the show "Troy".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
While on his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike, and was then struck by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately attended to by the on-track medical staff and transported to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat was unhurt in the accident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued by saying that "the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part.
We have a year-long financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the past two months, and I think now the financial markets are beginning to recover."
Last week, Naked News announced that it would dramatically increase its international language mandate to news reporting, with three new broadcasts.
Already reporting in English and Japanese, the global organization is launching Spanish, Italian, and Korean-language programs, for television, the web, and mobile devices.
"Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, as people tried to break windows in order to get out.
People were hitting the panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the panes finally broke, and they started to get out by the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of surface tension.
Surface tension happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them.
The water molecules make an invisible skin on the water’s surface that allows things like the needle to float on top of the water.
The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice, even when tilted.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon".
Scientists call this process "stimulated emission of radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.
The light bulb then needs replacing. It is necessary to be careful in replacing the light bulb.
First, the switch for the light fixture needs to be turned off or the cable disconnected.
This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket.
The major organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called arteries and comes back to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
A triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough branches and roots.
Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
How would Io's gravity pull on me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.
The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole Sun is made out of gases, fire, and plasma.
The gas becomes thinner as you go farther from the center of the Sun.
The outer-part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.
Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.
However in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from Danish domination.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.
Hangeul is the only purposely invented alphabet in popular daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded.
He originally named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the correct sounds for the instruction of the people".
There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.
With the battle for France over, Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain.
Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.
Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.
German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past were robbed, this tomb was left virtually undisturbed.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician Pythagoras, mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles.
There are varying estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one character "Õ/õ" was added.
As time passed, many words that were borrowed from German coalesced. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, earning a 2:2 (a lower second class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) includes 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.
Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in south west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the world's 37th-largest country, and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates from 1839.
Present-day parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past but became Belgian after the 1830s Belgian Revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but it was occupied in both World War I and World War II by Germany.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization which is today known as the European Union.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro District (in Phondey Village).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire caused for only some of the relics of the Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining to be one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century Cambodia found itself squeezed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, where the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent work in the oil industry.
Early in the nation's independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's national flower.
Every year around October nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains.
And then back to the north through the west, once again crossing the Mara river, after the rains in around April.
The Serengeti region contains the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you re-assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses.
This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.
Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public.
For that reason, everything you see on the TV had the borders cut, top, bottom and sides.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, it's borders will most likely be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring up images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even standing amidst thousand year-old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and smells of battles long gone, to almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobbles and to smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical for the period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a true castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.
In the 1480s, when its construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that Herostratus' name never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which is how we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - also try not to make much extraneous motion with your fingers.
This way, you will tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember there's no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.
On the accordion, to get extra volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/the deity or dieties.
Followers pursue certain ways of living, or practices that are intended to nurture those experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism though they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for "way of the guru". The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions but in Sikhism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). There followed in succession a further nine gurus.
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers were protesting against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against Communism.
Although in the end, Krushchev sent in tanks to restore order, he did give way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwest Indian subcontinent encompassing most of modern-day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.
The civilisation flourished in the basins of the Indus River wherefore it derives its name.
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilisation also existed in the basins of the now dried up Sarasvati River, it should be aptly called the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, while some call it the Harappan Civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman empire aided in the development of medical advances.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for use in the aftermath of battles.
Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from herbane seeds.
They became proficient at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as tourniquets and arterial clamps to stem blood flow.
Over multiple centuries, the Roman empire led to great gains in the field of medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold may be done at a time, more complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have straightforward locations.
